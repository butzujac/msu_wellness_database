# MSU Wellness Database Capstone Project

This repository contains the work for our Data Science Capstone Project. In this class, we partner with community partners in both industry and academia to work on a semester-long project. Our partner is the University Health and Wellbeing Department at Michigan State University. They promote the health and wellness of students, faculty, and staff through various programs and initiatives. We are interested in finding the best practices and approaches to supporting the needs of all students.

In our project, we are creating a database that stores information about various wellness initiatives, which will be able to be queried by leadership at MSU Wellness. To achieve this, we will web scrape information across the web to collect data, format the output into a readable database, and compare and contrast other programs using data visualization.
