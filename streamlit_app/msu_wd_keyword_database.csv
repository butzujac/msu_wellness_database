We encourage you to come by the BNC to talk about food security strategies and learn more about these programs. You can connect with a peer navigator at the BNC and discuss food strategies that might include our food assistance programs, the BNC and other local food pantries, SNAP support, and other local resources. 

Occurrence 2: You can find out what the bag's theme is on our Facebook and our instagram page. Our FOOD SECURITY Programs coordinator is dedicated to seeing that our low-income students (and staff) keep some healthy nutritional options in their diets. The bag includes the recipe slip that links to our Healthy Beaver Bag Blog. 

Occurrence 3: The allocation decisions for who gets food assistance funds is based on a series of questions designed to better understand your individual experience of food insecurity. In addition to these questions we ask that you provide any additional information that might be helpful in describing your food security needs and how Mealbux funds might play into your overall food security strategy. What information from my application is shared and with whom? 

Occurrence 4: We have to limit these resources to a one-time-per-student-per-term basis for budget reasons. Other BNC FOOD SECURITY resources may help. How do I give feedback?
